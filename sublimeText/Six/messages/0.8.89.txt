CHANGELOG 0.8.89

    Sublime Text needs to be restarted for the changes to work.

    FIX: The <count>G/<count>gg motions now work again in visual mode.
    FIX: Do not append <Esc> key to already complete command before repeating
         it with the dot operator (.).
    FIX: Allow six_press_key to receive a list of keys for backwards-compatibility
         with existing key bindings defined in a .sublime-keymap file.

         NOTE:
             The preferred way to add key bindings to Six in normal mode is
             through the :nmap command. Please refer to the 0.8.88 release
             notes for more information.

         CORRECTION:
             Previously, I mentioned that, in case of having the same keys bound
             in two different ways (through a .sublime-keymap file and as a Vim
             mapping through :nmap), the Vim mapping would take precedence. The
             opposite is true. Because the .sublime-keymap will most likely be
             evaluated before Six has a chance to capture the key stroke, the
             'native' binding will take precedence. This is important to know
             when you are debugging key bindings/mappings. As mentioned above,
             since version 0.8.88 it's best if you define normal mode mappings
             using the :nmap command in Six and abandon .sublime-keymap files.
