    ~ ANNOUNCEMENT ~

    There is now a Surround plugin for Sublime Six under development!

    https://github.com/SublimeSix/plugin-surround

    This plugin will serve as a testing ground for plugin implementation.
    Surround is a work in progress and open source.
    *********************************************************************************

    NEW: Highlight current search term in / motion if there is no match.
    NEW: Apply Regular Expressions syntax definition to / motion view.
    NEW: If there are selections present in insert mode, Esc switches directly to visual mode.

    FIX: Raise AbortCommandError from normal mode if command cannot be found.

    FIX: Last full command of a mapping now becomes the dot operator command for
         repeating.

    ~ TIP ~
    
        Six has two non-standard modes:
            - Multiple Selection Mode (MSM)
            - Multiple Line Selection Mode (MLSM)
        These two modes help you take advantage of Sublime Text multiple selections.

        To enter MSM, type gh. In this mode, you can press:
            - j to add selections
            - k to remove selections
            - l to skip the current selection

        You cannot run operators in this mode. However, you can switch to normal mode
        (Esc key) or visual mode (v key) first, and then run operators on the selected
        text.

        To enter MLSM, type gH. In this mode, you can press:
            - j to add a selection in the line below
            - k to add a selection in the line above

        To edit text selected in this way, proceed as in the case of MSM.

        All of this will be documented in the Six documentation.
