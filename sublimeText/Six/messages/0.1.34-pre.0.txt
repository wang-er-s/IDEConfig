CHANGELOG 0.1.34-pre.0

	REFACTOR INTERNAL: operators share more code

		Note:
		Most operators are affected by this refactor. Much of the
		work is now delegated to the base classes for operators.

		The structure of concrete operators has also been unified.
		All tests are passing, but some behavior changes may have
		slipped through.
