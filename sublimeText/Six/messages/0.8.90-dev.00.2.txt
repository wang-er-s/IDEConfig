CHANGELOG 0.8.90-dev.00.2

    Sublime Text needs to be restarted for the changes to work.

    NEW: Highlight current search term in / motion if there is no match.
    NEW: Apply Regular Expressions syntax definition to / motion view.
    FIX: Let exceptions in visual line mode handler bubble up so UI updating gets
         taken care of by Editor.
    FIX: Capture insert mode operations for repeating while expanding a mapping.
    FIX: Last full command of a mapping now becomes the dot operator command for
         repeating.
