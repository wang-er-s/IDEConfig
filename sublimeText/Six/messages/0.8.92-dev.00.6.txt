CHANGELOG 0.8.92-dev.00.6

    Sublime Text needs to be restarted for the changes to work.

    NEW: Key tokenizer accepts <Plug> token.
    FIX: Suppress mappings when a normal mode command name is partially completed.
         This ensures that users can map <CR> and z<CR> will still work.
    FIX: Improve command resolution so that mode handlers can have plugins.
    FIX: Ensure that dot operator (.) can repeat commands including plugins.
    FIX: Ensure that plugins can run from mappings.
    TEST: Test Editor.init mode activation and mode reconciliation.
