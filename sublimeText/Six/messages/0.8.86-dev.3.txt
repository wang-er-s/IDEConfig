CHANGELOG 0.8.86-dev.3

    Sublime Text needs to be restarted for the changes to work.

    NEW: Enable <Tab> key. For example, in df<Tab>.
    NEW: Partial implementation of :nmap command.

    NOTES:
        You can add normal mode mappings with
            :nmap lhs rhs
        and you can make Six display added mappings with
            :nmap

        Mappings are not yet expanded or used in any way other than described.
        Also, they are not persisted between Sublime Text sessions.
