CHANGELOG 0.8.88

    Sublime Text needs to be restarted for the changes to work.

    NEW: Add dot icon next to matching line in slash incremental search to
         increase match visibility.
    FIX: Extraneous selections in normal mode now cause SilentCommandError.

        NOTE: 
            If you use 'native' Sublime Text commands, such as GoTo Definition
            (Ctrl+q or Ctrl+Shift+q in Six), you may inadvertently create a non-empty
            selection region while in normal mode. This state is illegal in normal
            mode. Up to now, the normal mode handler would accept commands in this
            state and ignore the selection. From this build on, a SilentCommandError
            is raised, the selection is collapsed, the user is given visual feedback
            and the command is aborted.

            The exception is if you try to enter visual mode. In this case, the selection
            is preserved and no error is raised.
