CHANGELOG 0.1.56

	NEW: ex mode now uses a dedicated input panel

	NOTE:

		The ex mode panel uses the Six Ex Mode syntax definition. This means
		that you can apply settings to the panel. For example, you can set
		a color scheme using the color_scheme setting in User/Six Ex Mode.sublime-settings.
