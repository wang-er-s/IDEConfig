CHANGELOG 0.1.44

	NEW: basic help system via the :h(elp) <keyword> command.
	NEW: basic K command in normal mode for navigating help topics.

	NOTES:

		If you run the :h command without an argument, the TOC will open.

		The Sublime Six help files mainly document behaviors that vary
		compared to Vim.

		For general help about commands, you should consult the Vim help
		files, for example at http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/.
