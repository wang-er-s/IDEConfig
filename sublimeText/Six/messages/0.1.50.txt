CHANGELOG 0.1.50

	This version includes no changes.

	ANNOUNCEMENT

		If Six won't load for you, this information may help you.

		Six switched from a .sublime-package-based install to a folder-based
		install a few versions ago. This change should have been transparent
		to users, but Package Control may fail to delete the pre-existing
		.sublime-package file, which will cause Six to fail loading.

		To solve this issue, open the Data/Installed Packages folder [1] on
		your platform and delete any Six.sublime-package file you see in
		there. After restarting Sublime Text, Six should load normally from
		Data/Packages/Six.

		If after trying the above steps you are still experiencing issues
		running Six, please report an issue at
		https://github.com/guillermooo/Six/issues.
