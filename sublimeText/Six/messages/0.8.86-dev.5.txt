CHANGELOG 0.8.86-dev.5

    Sublime Text needs to be restarted for the changes to work.

    NEW: Enable mapping expansion in normal mode.

    NOTES:

        Mapping functionality is a work in progress and it isn't fully
        functional.

        When debugging mappings, keep in mind that you now have to consider
        both Sublime Text mappings and Six mappings. They may interact in
        undesired ways if you have the same mapping defined as both a native
        Sublime Text mapping and a Six mapping.

        You can now define mappings in normal mode using:

            :nmap lhs rhs

        You can see the currently available mappings with the following
        command:

            :nmap

        Example:

            :nmap ,d /Debug<CR>

        The previous mapping causes ,d to expand to /Debug<CR> in normal mode.
        This way, you can perform that search with few keystrokes.

        You can create mappings for ex mode commands too.

        Example:

            :nmap ,r :reg<CR>
            :nmap <Space> :

        At the moment, you cannot create mappings that interact with insert mode.

        Mappings are not persisted across Sublime Text sessions. There is no way
        to have mappings defined at start-up. These features are planned, but not
        available yet.

        Well, actually, there is an _unsupported_ way of defining maps at
        start-up. You can add mappings using a Python file in your User
        folder. It should contain something along these lines:

                from Six._init_ import editor
                from Six.lib.constants import Mode

                editor.mappings.add(Mode.Normal, 'Y', 'y$')

        However, this may break at any time as work on the mapping
        functionality progresses.
