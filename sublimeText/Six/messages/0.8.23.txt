CHANGELOG 0.8.23

    Please restart Sublime Text for the changes to work.

    FIX: show search hit in the center of the viewport if it's off the screen.
    FIX: abort command line command if no views are active.
    FIX: multiple selection commands (gh) are now handled directly in Default.sublime-keymap.

        NOTE: This is necessary so that soft_undo and find_under_expand run as a window command.
