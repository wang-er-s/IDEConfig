CHANGELOG 0.8.102-dev.20180922.6

    Sublime Text needs to be restarted for the changes to work.

    NEW: gj and gk in visual mode.
    FIX: Improve implementation of gj, gk.
    
    	NOTES:
    	gj and gk rely extensively on Sublime Text native commands
    	and currently have limitations in terms of Vim behavior.
