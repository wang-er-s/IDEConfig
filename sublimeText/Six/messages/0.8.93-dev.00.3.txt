CHANGELOG 0.8.93-dev.00.3

    Sublime Text needs to be restarted for the changes to work.

    NEW: It is now possible to switch to insert mode from multiple selection
         and multiple line selection mode by pressing 'i'.
    FIX: Drastically decrease timeout period used to detect when user has
         switched to an external app and back (affects visual modes).
